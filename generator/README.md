# Streaming Infrastructure

## Goal
The goal of the project is to build a streaming architecture to process a high amount of cash receipts and provide insights on data using a dashboard.

## Getting started
Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (automatically installed with Docker in latest versions).
Run `docker-compose up` to run the images (or `docker-compose up -d` in detached mode). Run `docker-compose build` to re-build the images.

If running in detached mode, you can use `docker-compose ps` to see the processes currently running and `docker-compose stop` to stop them.
